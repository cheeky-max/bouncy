# Bouncy

## Description

Bouncy is a game where you have to bounce a ball on a paddle.

Move the mouse to move the paddle. Every time you bounce the ball, your score goes up by one. If you miss, your score goes back to zero. Each bounce makes the ball go faster and higher. Press <kbd>F11</kbd> to go to full screen.
